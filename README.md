# Angular Item Editor

A two-page SPA for displaying items (or rather statistics) as a table list and editing one at a time. Also:
* has an ability to persist the data in Session Storage to imitate a real database modification
* uses Angular Material

Current limitations:
* no tests included
* item table has no pagination due to a complex and weird nature of Angular Material :D 

## How to run


```bash
# Optionally install Angular CLI
npm install -g @angular/cli

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve on localhost:4200
ng serve
```
